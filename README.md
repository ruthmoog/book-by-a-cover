# Book By A Cover

This CSS project recreates book covers using HMTL and CSS.

I used this project to learn more about creative CSS, and practise semantic HTML.

#### Future ideas

- I plan to host the project online eventually.
- I'd like to learn about animating with CSS and animate some book covers.

## Contents

Files are in the following formats:
Content files: `book_title.html`
Style files: `style_titleinitials.css` eg "How To Cake It" is `style_htci.css`

## Books

- Our Garden Birds by Matt Sewell
- How To Cake It by Yolanda Gampp
- The Outsiders by SE Hinton

## Contribute

Suggestions welcome!  This was a really fun project and I would recommend doing the same from scratch to learn more about vanilla HTML & CSS - maybe film posters, album covers, or event tickets.
