# Book By A Cover

This CSS project recreates book covers using HMTL and CSS.

I used this project to learn more about creative CSS, and practise semantic HTML.

#### Future ideas

- I'd like to learn about animating with CSS and animate some book covers.

## Contribute

Suggestions welcome!  This was a really fun project and I would recommend doing the same from scratch to learn more about vanilla HTML & CSS - maybe film posters, album covers, or event tickets.
